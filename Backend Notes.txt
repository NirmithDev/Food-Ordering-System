Food Ordering System Backend Notes
- Initialize the project add necessary modules from Spring Initializer
- Add database connection for MYSql and add password
- Create Model folders which will contain our table models/schema
- Create Entities commit https://github.com/NirmithDev/Food-Ordering-System/pull/7 and https://github.com/NirmithDev/Food-Ordering-System/pull/12
	- we add id for user and orders
	- we add a One to Many relationships for the user orders because a user has many orders
	- we add jsonIgnore because whenever I fetch the user I do not need this list we are isolating this because we are going to build a separate Order API to fetch all user orders
	- we create a dto package and add a Restaurant DTO what it is is essentially a data transfer object
		- we add embeddable to that class
	- we then add a list of addresses for the user class the relationship is also OneToMany
	- create the address class with the id and all as a Entity
		- we add this to it cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true because when we delete the user we want to remove all data related to him from the system
	- now we are working on Order Entity
	- we create the restaurant and userName object and assign ManyToOne relationships
	- we add items as well which include which all things user has ordered in that order
	- we add the objects for order and complete it
	- we also create a OrderItem schema which has just the id atm 
	- we then created the entities for IngredientCategory and Ingredients
	- we also created Restaurant entity
	- we also created CartItem Cart
	- we completed previous uncompleted classes such as ContactInfomation, Order, Restaurant and so on.
